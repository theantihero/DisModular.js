   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dismodular.js.git
   cd dismodular.js
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your test bot credentials
   ```

4. **Set Up Database**
   ```bash
   npm run setup:db
   ```

5. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Coding Guidelines

### JavaScript/Node.js Style

- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, async/await)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add semicolons

### File Organization

- Follow the existing package structure
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Use index.js for exports
- Place tests next to source files

### React/Frontend

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the MVVM pattern (ViewModels for state)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop-types or TypeScript types

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(dashboard): add analytics page with real-time metrics
fix(sandbox): resolve function cloning error in executor
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test plugins in both slash and message command modes
- Test on multiple Discord servers if possible
